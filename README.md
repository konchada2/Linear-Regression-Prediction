## Introduction :
Lets first know what we mean by Regression. Regression is a statistical way to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and a set of independent variable(s). e.g., if we say that

Age = 5 + Height * 10 + Weight * 13

Here we are establishing a relationship between Height & Weight of a person with his/ Her Age. This is a very basic example of Regression.
Simple Linear Regression

Least Square “Linear Regression” is a statistical method to regress the data with dependent variable having continuous values whereas independent variables can have either continuous or categorical values. In other words “Linear Regression” is a 
method to predict dependent variable (Y) based on values of independent variables (X).  It can be used for the cases where we 
want to predict some continuous quantity.
